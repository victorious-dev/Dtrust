# DTrust - Decentralized Trust Agreements

The DTrust DApp generates customized smart trust agreements (dtrusts) to run on the ethereum network. The agreements enable users to manage the control and enjoyment of digital assets across time. Users recieve control keys in ERC-20 tokens that enable certain powers of control with respect to assets held in dtrusts. The DApp charges 0.5% per year from assets held in its customized dtrusts. There are Promote tokens and DT tokens. Promoters can arrange dtrusts with their Promote token and then recieve the first two years fees. All subsequent fees go to the DT tokens, which also vote on changes to the DTrust protocol. 

Goal: Enable trust legal strategies on Ethereum
